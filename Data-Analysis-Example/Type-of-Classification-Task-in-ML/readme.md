Classification is a task that requires the use of machine learning algorithms that can learn how to assign a class label to examples from the problem domain. An easy to understand example is classifying emails as "spam" or "not spam".

Thus, in this time, we will look at several different methods for doing classification, that are:

1.   Binary Classification
2.   Multi-Class Classification
3.   Multi-Label Classification
4.   Imbalanced Classification

In a nutshell, the study of classification involves:

*   Classification predictive modeling involves assigning a class label to input examples.
*   Binary classification refers to predicting one of two classes and multi-class classification involves predicting one of more than two classes.
*   Multi-label classification involves predicting one or more classes for each example and imbalanced classification refers to classification tasks where the distribution of examples across the classes is not equal.
